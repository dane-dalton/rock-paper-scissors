# rock-paper-scissors
A game of rock, paper, scissors. I'll start off writing it in the console, then making a GUI for it later on.

Major learning points: recursion has its place, but ONLY use it if you INTEND to use the recursion tree. Ran into a lot of issues restarting the game by calling the game function again.
