# rock-paper-scissors
A game of rock, paper, scissors. I'll start off writing it in the console, then making a GUI for it later on.

Major learning points: recursion has its place, but ONLY use it if you INTEND to use the recursion tree. Ran into a lot of issues restarting the game by calling the game function again.

Friendly reminder to myself: if become aware that I may be overthinking the problem, I probably am. Additionally, do not be afraid to just start over fresh with a new approach. Lots of time would have been saved had I done this sooner.
